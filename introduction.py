### Trading


Everyone has heard of the term "**trading**". The majority of us have traded in our daily lives, even if we are unaware of it. Everything you buy in a store is essentially a trade of money for the goods you desire.

It is the same principle when we talk about trading in financial markets. Consider someone who trades stocks. They are, in fact, purchasing shares (or a small portion of a company). If the value of those shares rises, they profit by reselling them at a higher price. This is a form of trading. You buy something at one price and sell it at a higher price, hopefully making a profit, and vice versa. But one may think  why would the value of the stock rise? The answer is simple: value changes due to supply and demand â€“ the higher the demand for something, the higher the price people are willing to pay for it. So for these matching of Supply and demand at a  certain price and placing a trade accurately for maximum profit is impossible for human capabilities So we take help of computer code to place a trade when our certain requirements are met. Algorithmic trading accounts for around 60-73% of the overall United States equity trading.


### Algorithmic Trading


**Algorithmic trading** is a method of executing orders that uses automated pre-programmed trading instructions that take variables such as time, price, and volume into account. Algorithmic trading strategies use a rule-based system to select trading instruments, identify trading opportunities, manage risk, and optimize position size and capital use. In most cases, systems are automated, so the algorithm also executes entries and exits. The terms algorithmic trading, systematic trading, electronic trading, black-box trading, mechanical trading, and quantitative trading are sometimes used interchangeably. HFT, also known as high-frequency trading, is frequently associated with algorithmic trading. Indeed, high-frequency trading (HFT) is based on lightning-fast algorithms that take advantage of price differences between exchanges.
