Technical analysts use the relative strength index (RSI) to determine whether a stock or other asset is overbought or oversold. The RSI measures the magnitude of recent price changes and is used to determine whether a stock or other asset has reached an overbought or oversold condition. The RSI provides technical traders with signals about bullish and bearish price momentum, and it is often plotted beneath the graph of an assetâ€™s price. An asset is usually considered overbought when the RSI is above 70% and oversold below 30%.


The RSI is computed with a two-part calculation that starts with the following formula:

$RSI_{\\text{step one}} = 100 - [\\frac{100}{1+\\frac{Average Gain}{Average Loss}}]$

Here, we use only positive values for the case of Average Loss. Assume the market closed higher seven out of the last fourteen days, averaging 1%. The subsequent seven days closed lower by an average of 0.8%. The first portion of the RSI calculation is as follows:
$55.55 = 100 - [\\frac{100}{1 + \\frac{1\%/14}{0.8\%/14}}]$

The second portion of the RSI formula can be calculated after 14 periods of data are available. The second step in the algorithm smoothes out the output.

$RSI_{\\text{step two}} = 100 - [\\frac{100}{1+\\frac{(Previous Average Gain)\\times13) + Current Gain}{(Previous Average Loss)\\times13) + Current Loss}}]$
